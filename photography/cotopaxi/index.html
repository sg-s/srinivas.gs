		<h1>An unexpected start</h1>

		

		<p>Cotopaxi, which means "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotopaxi#Name">neck of the moon</a>", is a active stratovolcano in Ecuador. When I was thirteen or so, I read Alistair MacLean’s <em>The Guns of Navarone</em>. In it, Keith Mallory, the crack-climber-turned-leader of a commando invasion of the island of Navarone, remembers fragments of a poem that mentions Cotopaxi. </p>

		<p>Well, one thing lead to another, and ten years later, I decided to climb Cotopaxi. </p>

				<p class = "poem-title">ROMANCE</p>
				When I was but thirteen or so<br>
				I went into a golden land,<br>
				Chimborazo, Cotopaxi,<br>
				Took me by the hand.<br>
				<br>
				My father died, my brother too,<br>
				They passed like fleeting dreams,<br>
				I stood where Popocatapetl<br>
				In the sunlight gleams.<br>
				<br>
				I dimly heard the master's voice<br>
				And boys' far-off at play,<br>
				Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br>
				Had stolen me away.<br>
				<br>
				I walked in a great golden dream<br>
				To and fro from school -<br>
				Shining Popocatapetl<br>
				The dusty streets did rule.<br>
				<br>
				I walked home with a gold dark boy<br>
				And never a word I'd say<br>
				Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br>
				Had taken my speech away:<br>
				<br>
				I gazed entranced upon his face<br>
				Fairer than any flower -<br>
				O shining Popocatapetl<br>
				It was thy magic hour:<br>
				<br>
				The houses, people, traffic seemed<br>
				Thin, fading dreams by day,<br>
				Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br>
				They had stolen my soul away.<br>

		<h1>Baños and Tungurahua</h1>

		<p>The thermal springs town of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C3%B1os_de_Agua_Santa">Baños</a> spreads out in a valley beneath an active volcano called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungurahua">Tungurahua</a>, shown erupting in this dramatic if uninformative map. In October 1999, Baños was evacuated when Tungurahua threatened to erupt once more.</p>

		<p>Baños is a beautiful city, with hiking and biking trails, and a generally easy-going disposition. The sun shines benevolently on this little town, till at least the volcano kills everyone in it. </p>

		<h1>Pasochoa and Quilotoa</h1>

		<p>When the amateur adventurer attempts to climb Cotopaxi, he is reminded that it’s a little high up, and a little acclimatisation to the altitude goes a long way. Keeping this in mind, we decided to cross the wind-swept landscape and climb some smaller peaks.</p>

		<div class = "sidenote">
		<p>1/250 sec @ f/9 <br>Olympus E520</p>
		</div>

		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sg-s/srinivas.gs/master/photography/cotopaxi/assets/wind.jpg"  onerror='this.onerror = null; this.src="./assets/wind.jpg"'/>

		<div class = "sidenote">
		<a style="font-size:38px">4200m</a><br>above mean sea level</p>
		</div>

		<p>The first peak on the list was the ancient, extinct volcano of Pasochoa. It offered spectacular views all around, and Cotopaxi loomed broodingly in the distance:</p>

		

		<div class = "sidenote">
		<p>1/320 sec @ f/10 <br>Olympus E520</p>

		<p>According to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasochoa">Wikipedia</a>, the former volcanic fury of mighty Pasochoa has long since been quenched, and the only remnants of its awesome power is in the incredible fertility of its soil. </p>

		<p>Next on the list was Quilotoa, another volcano past its prime, but also suffering from a leaky faucet. Its large caldera, once the flinger of massive lava bombs, is now a glorified wash basin:</p>

		<p>1/250 sec @f/8 <br>Olympus E520</p>

		<div class = "sidenote">
		<a style="font-size:38px">3914m</a><br>above mean sea level</p>
		</div>

		<p>...which came in handy, as the climb down to the lake in the middle of the caldera was incredibly dusty:</p>

		<p>We are ready. We have conquered some dead volcanoes, and are ready for the real thing: Cotopaxi, in all its fiery glory; Cotopaxi, the active volcano, that could theoretically blow up and kill us all any minute; Cotopaxi, snow-shrouded, storm-veiled strato-peak, how you take my heart away!</p>

		<h1>Cotopaxi</h1>

		<p>We climbed Cotopaxi with an Alpine start, which is a fancy way of saying that we woke up at midnight and started climbing the mountain in complete darkness. Which is why I have no pictures here. Also, there were sixty kilometre-an-hour winds and it was freezing cold. I saw some snow, and some ice. But it was mostly blundering up the mountain in the dark, wondering if I needed to get my head examined.</p>

		<div class = "sidenote">
		<a style="font-size:38px">5897m</a><br>above mean sea level</p>

		<p>Finally, after many tortuous hours, the sun arose, and I saw some fantastic ice and snow formations:</p>

		<p>There was ice in all forms, sometimes in spectacular walls like this: </p>
