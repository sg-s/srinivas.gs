        <p>The Adirondack Park is a 6 million acre nature reserve with 10,000 lakes and 30,000 miles of rivers and streams. It is oldest protected area in the US, and is protected by Article VII, Section 7, of the New York State Constitution.</p>

        <h1>The High Peaks</h1>

        <p>There are 46 High Peaks in the Adirondacks (defined as mountains over 4000 feet). The image below shows a stylized map of the High Peaks area, with Algonquin Peak (5115 ft), Mt. Marcy (5344 ft), Dix Mountain (4840 ft), and Giant Mountain (4626 ft).</p>

        <p>There is only one way up the top, and it is via fantastic trails that snake up the mountain, crossing a variety of ecological zones before ending in the Alpine wastes at the top. Early morning mist on the lower sections of the trail up Cascade and Porter Mountains is captures in the sunlight:</p>

        <p>You can see the vegetation change slowly as you climb up the mountain, with deciduous trees giving way to firs and pine, and then finally to small stunted trees, and after you cross the tree line, nothing remaining but a few tenacious lichen.</p>

        <p>Not every mountain is accessible with a short day hike. Some of them require you to camp overnight in the wilderness. Our first trip the Adirondacks involved us losing our way, not knowing that there were bears, and wandering in the dark in circles while we tried to re-locate our tent after cooking. This picture was taken somewhere in the Dix Mountain Wilderness, in a dark forest inhabited by what we felt were several bears.</p>

        <p>Fall is the best time of year to climb to High Peaks. Apart from the trails being mostly free of winter snow, the trees are brilliant. Looking up, you can see the speckled gold of the sun-lit leaves peter out into the brilliant blue of the mountain sky. </p>

        <p>Every part of the forest is vibrant, and lit with a golden light. When I took this photograph, I remember noticing that the camera failed entirely at capturing the sheer intensity of color that I could see in front of me.</p>

        <h1>Winter in the Adirondacks</h1>


        <p>In the winter, the Adirondacks become an entirely different beast. Casual hikers do not return, and instead, new species move in to fill the void: ice climbers, winter hikers with enormous snowshoes, and ice skaters. Here is the same view of the Lower Cascade Lake, but in winter. The Lake has frozen over completely, and the deciduous trees are bare, leaving only the conifers.</p>

        <p>There's quite a bit of snow, as you can see in this photograph of the delightfully named Fangorn Forest. Snowshoes are essential.</p>
