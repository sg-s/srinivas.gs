                        This is a highly simplified simulation of what could have happened if you had (or not) done a
                        PhD. It is not a prediction of what will happen to you.

                        As such, a number of simplifying assumptions are made.

                        <ul>
                            <li>We ignore the possibility of getting into a PhD program, and leaving with a Master's
                                degree. In many PhD Programs, this is a possibility, and is sometimes forced onto
                                candidates that are not able to complete the PhD, or that fail their qualifying exams.
                            </li>
                            <li>We focus on PhD in Science-adjacent fields (Biology, Physics, Maths, etc.). I honestly
                                don't know anything about PhDs in other fields, so I'm not sure how to model them.
                            </li>
                            <li>We assume that only federal taxes are paid. State taxes are ignored and assumed to be
                                negligible.
                            </li>
                            <li>We assume that there are no other sources of income, and therefore no other taxes to be
                                paid. For tax purposes, we assume a single filer and no dependents.
                            </li>
                            <li>We assume that there are never any medical issues or expenses. No illnesses, no hospital
                                stays, no substantial costs for medical treatment.
                            </li>
                            <li>For the simplicity of the simulation, we assume that the following events are linked
                                together: change in job status, change in rental expenses, change in other expenses. We
                                don't model moving houses at times other than changes in jobs.
                            </li>
                            <li>We assume that you never get married or have children.
                            </li>
                            <li>We assume that you can have a negative net worth, and that there is no cost to this.
                                (This effectively simulates a very low interest loan with infinite flexibility)
                            </li>
                            <li>Shares granted by company are assumed to have no value.

                                There are many reasons to do a PhD: because you're really interested in the subject,
                                because you love the process of research, you love being in a university, or (maybe)
                                because you believe it is required for your eventual career.

                                However, it is important to realize that we don't live in a vacuum. We live (for now) in
                                a (capitalist) society, where the niceness of your house, your ability to (not) die of
                                preventable diseases, and your ability to retire comfortably are all dependent
                                (entirely) on your ability to amass wealth. The more money you earn/have/steal, the
                                nicer your
                                house is, the more likely you won't die because you can't afford insulin, and the more
                                likely your child will go to a school where the teachers are paid something above a
                                poverty wage.

                                Given the overwhelming nature of this reality, it is important to consider the
                                tradeoffs between different future paths. Passionate about research in complex systems?
                                Want to spend a good chunk of your life working on problems no one, in the entire
                                history of the world, has ever worked on? Want to discover something new and advance the
                                frontiers of human knowledge one tiny bit? You <em>may</em> want to do a PhD. But do so
                                knowing full
                                well that this will cost you, and your family, a lot of money. This simulation helps you
                                put a number to that. As inaccurate as it may be, I would argue that it's more accurate
                                than the number you had in your head before you started this experience.

                                Unless you're independently wealthy and/or a nepo baby, there is a real, numerical
                                monetary cost to doing a PhD. It's your choice to make, but make it a slightly more
                                informed one.
