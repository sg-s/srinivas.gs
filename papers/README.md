| [Failure of Averaging](http://jn.physiology.org/content/87/2/1129.short) | Marder | Neuroscience | 2002 | People often think that the "true" value of parameters can be approximated by averaging over several realizations of a model, or experimental replicates. However, if your data is distributed in concave sets, then the mean of the set lies outside the set -- and is not representative of anything in the set. | 
| [Predictability and hierarchy in Drosophila behavior]() | Shaevitz | Data visualization and analysis | 2016 | This is the gold standard of automated, unsupervised behaviour analysis without explicit definitions of patterns. It's a great way to represent the full range of behaviours in a freely behaving system.  |
