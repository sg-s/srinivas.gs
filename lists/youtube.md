# My YouTube Media diet

I watch a fair bit of content on YouTube. This list 
is a semi-random, non-ordered collection of channels I
watch, with some notes about each. 


## [ 3Blue1Brown ](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)

Watching a 3Blue1Brown video is like reading GEB -- it 
feels like someone is injecting something sublime directly
into your brain and you can glimpse at beauty you could
never imagine every now and then.

- [The Windmill question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM)
- [How to lie using visual proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYQVlVoWoPY&t=961s)

## [The Engineer Guy](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerguyvideo)

- [The Ingenious Design of the Aluminum Beverage Can ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw)
- [Anodizing (Or the beauty of corrosion) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZhVOy-ytJY)


## [World War Two](https://www.youtube.com/@WorldWarTwo)

What's to say? I look forward to this every Saturday. 
The vast majority of my brain is devoted to obscure factoids
about World War and contemplating deployments during the
[Great Patriotic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War_(term)). 

It's hard to list any videos here because you really 
have to watch the whole thing. 


## [Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/@WelchLabsVideo)

I don't know why I subscribed to this, or when, but they
came out with a series on the Manhattan Project which is one
of the most beautifully produced and informative videos I've
ever seen. Truly spectacular.

- [The Most Dangerous Rock in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-FuqptTZow)


## [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections)

Come for the truly awful puns, and spend several hours
watching videos about dishwashers. Before you know it, 
you're a zealot about the color brown and heat pumps. 

- [Detergent packs are kinda wishy-washy (Dishwashers Explained)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBO8neWw04)
- [Brown; color is weird ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU)
- [The Senseless Ambiguity of North American Turn Signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1lZ9n2bxWA)

## [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium)

I almost always enjoy a Veritasium video. He typically
starts off with a big bold claim which seems outrageous at 
first, and my immediate response is to say "No way that's
true" -- but I've learnt by now that it doesn't pay to bet
against him. A number of videos that have changed how 
I think about things I thought I understood.


- [The Big Misconception About Electricity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY)
- [Why No One Has Measured The Speed Of Light ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k)
- [A Physics Prof Bet Me $10,000 I'm Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCsgoLc_fzI)
- [The Riddle That Seems Impossible Even If You Know The Answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA)


## [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/@TomScottGo)

Tom Scott makes a video every week. And they're awesome. 
If you've somehow gone this long without seeing a Tom Scott
video, I'd love to know size of the rock you live under.

- [Do The Numbers On Toaster Dials Mean Minutes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN_PK5pXmIY)
- [I tried using AI. It scared me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPhJbKBuNnA)
- [Why Britain Uses Separate Hot and Cold Taps ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfHgUu_8KgA)
- [Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs)
